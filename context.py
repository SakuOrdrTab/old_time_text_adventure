CONTEXT = '''
The context of the adventure game is the iron age Finland, about 1000 BC. People live in the harsh finnish wild, hunting 
and fishing and usually live quite separately in remote wooden houses enclosing one family. Starvation and misery prevail
and there are frequent clashes between the tribes of Savonia, Carelia and finns, and everyone hates and fears the
people of lapland. In contrast to reality, this is the world of Kalevala epic, and there exists also magic and 
wizards. Winter's are harsh, with long night and freezing temperatures and summers are mild and days are long. The 
more precise location for the game is ancient western Finland, when this is relevant to generate messages to the
player.
