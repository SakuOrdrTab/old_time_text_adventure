STYLE = "scenic photograph"

CONTEXT = '''
The context of the adventure game is the iron age Finland, about 1000 BC. People live in the harsh finnish wild, hunting 
and fishing and usually live quite separately in remote wooden houses enclosing one family. Starvation and misery prevail
and there are frequent clashes between the tribes of Savonia, Carelia and finns, and everyone hates and fears the
people of lapland. In contrast to reality, this is the world of Kalevala epic, and there exists also magic and 
wizards. Winter's are harsh, with long night and freezing temperatures and summers are mild and days are long. The 
more precise location for the game is ancient western Finland, when this is relevant to generate messages to the
player.

SYNOPSIS = '''
The synopsis of the adventure game is, that at the start of the game, player returns to his home
from a succesfull hunting trip. However, his home has been attacked and whole family slaughered
and the house is burnt. This is all that the player knows. Of course he or she feels powerful
urge to avenge family's illfull fate.
The following is the suggested course of the adventure game:
- Player may want to learn some clues about the attackers. In fact it was a lapland raiding party,
but this is not evident and the player may find some clues that point to lapland
- If the player chooses to travel northwards towards lapland, he will encounter most bizarre events
and perils on the course.
- In the lapland, the actual attacking group has been powerful witch Louhi's men. In order to avenge,
player must deal with Louhi on some way or another.
- If player chooses to fight Louhi, this will be very difficult as Louhi is a powerful witch with magic,
as in Kalevala epic. It is very possible, that the player perishes.
- If the player perishes, there is a small chance that the adventure continues in "manala" which is the
mythological finnish afterlife.
- Succesful completion and the end of game is a suitable revenge for the gruesome loss of family.
