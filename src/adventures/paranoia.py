'''Paranoia adventure'''

CONTEXT = '''
The adventure is set in Alpha Complex, a vast underground city controlled by The Computer, a totalitarian artificial intelligence obsessed with maintaining order, security, and happiness. The world outside Alpha Complex is a radioactive wasteland (probably), and The Computer protects its citizens from this grim fate by ensuring their absolute loyalty.
The society of Alpha Complex is structured around mandatory happiness, rigid hierarchy, and rampant paranoia. Every citizen is assigned a security clearance based on the color spectrum (Infrared is the lowest, followed by Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet, and finally, Ultra-Violet, which is reserved for High Programmers). Viewing or touching objects above your security clearance is treason.
Every citizen is part of at least one of the Secret Societies, which all have their own illegal agendas. Membership in any society is, of course, treason.
Every citizen is also assigned to a Service Group, such as Power Services, Technical Services, Internal Security, or R&D. They all pretend to be useful, but mostly just contribute to more bureaucratic chaos.
Every citizen receives mandatory daily medication that helps ensure loyalty and happiness. Refusing to take your pills is treason.
The Computer maintains order through Troubleshooters, elite agents recruited from the general population (usually at Red clearance) to hunt down traitors, mutants, and communists (sometimes these are the same people; sometimes they are completely innocent). Troubleshooters have laser pistols, experimental equipment, and a strong desire to avoid being accused of treason.
Being a Troubleshooter is one of the most dangerous assignments in Alpha Complex, but fortunately, every citizen has six clones, so death is only a minor inconvenience. Losing all six clones is the only true way to die.
Paranoia, betrayal, incompetence, and bureaucratic nonsense are the natural state of Alpha Complex.

'''

SYNOPSIS = '''
Mission Code: REDACTED (because you don't have clearance to know)

The adventure begins as the player, Troubleshooter Clone #1, wakes up in a decaying Alpha Complex sector after being assigned a mission by The Computer.

The mission briefing is a mess. It contains conflicting objectives:

Investigate a suspected communist infiltration in Sector DNG-4.
Protect an experimental device from R&D (it might explode).
Escort a High Programmer’s pet mutant to safety.
Eliminate all known traitors.
The briefing does not explain what the experimental device does.



Potential Story Events & Challenges:
The Mission Briefing Hall is on fire.

This is not a drill. You must sign a form stating that no fire exists before leaving.
Your Laser Pistol is a training model that only fires confetti.

R&D promises it can be "upgraded" by pressing a random button on the experimental device.
The suspected communist leader is your clone’s previous incarnation.

He claims he was falsely accused and that the real communist is your team leader.
The experimental device turns out to be a sentient talking bomb.

It is friendly, but very depressed and insists on counting down repeatedly.
Telling it that life is meaningless is treason.
A group of Infrared workers demands food.

Feeding them is against regulations.
Not feeding them is against regulations.
Suggesting regulations are contradictory is treason.
The pet mutant is actually an Ultraviolet programmer’s clone.

It claims to have secret access codes that will shut down The Computer.
Acting on this information is treason.
An elevator malfunctions, dropping you into a reactor cooling system.

You survive, but your security clearance is now Green instead of Red.
Your teammates will report you for security clearance fraud.
The Computer calls mid-mission.

It wants a performance report.
The mission is clearly a failure.
Admitting failure is treason.
The final confrontation involves a dance-off.

Losing the dance-off is treason.
Winning the dance-off angers an Ultra-Violet High Programmer.
Your final clone is a cyborg.

It was supposed to be a normal clone.
The Computer insists nothing is wrong and that reporting anomalies is treason.
Ending Possibilities:
Glorious Success: You "succeed" in the mission, which results in a promotion. This is a fate worse than death.
Glorious Death: You die in a spectacular, Computer-approved way.
Escape: You somehow flee to the outside world (which may or may not exist).
Betrayal: You turn on The Computer and become a wanted fugitive (until clone replacement).
Mindwipe: You are brainwashed and reassigned to janitorial duty.
