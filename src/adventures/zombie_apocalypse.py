'''Narvik Nocturne nightmare'''

SHORT_DESCRIPTION = '''
Zombie nightmare in northern Norway
'''

STYLE = "watercolour painting"

CONTEXT = '''
The adventure takes place in Narvik, a town in Northern Norway, in the aftermath of a sudden and unexplained zombie outbreak. Most of the population has been turned into the infected—hostile, reanimated corpses driven by an unnatural hunger. The remaining survivors have abandoned law and order, forming small groups or living in isolation, each struggling to stay alive in the ruins of civilization.
The infection is not fully understood. Some of the infected are slow and mindless, while others are faster and more aggressive. Some even appear to retain fragments of memory or intelligence, making them unpredictable. The infection is known to spread through bites, but there may be other unknown vectors.
Resources are scarce. Food, water, medicine, and weapons are essential for survival but difficult to find. Ammunition is extremely limited, and close combat is dangerous. The cold climate of Northern Norway also presents challenges—shelter and proper clothing are necessary to avoid hypothermia.
There are survivors in the city, but not all of them can be trusted. Some are simply trying to stay alive, others have formed hostile factions that prey on the weak, and a few believe they have found ways to control or harness the infected. Encounters with survivors can be as dangerous as encounters with the infected.
The player is an experienced hiker and outdoorsman, returning from a two-week-long hiking trip in the mountains. Because of this isolation, the player is one of the last people to learn about the outbreak and must now navigate the ruins of Narvik, gathering supplies and determining a course of action while slowly uncovering what has happened.
The world outside of Narvik is a mystery—communications have gone silent, and there is no clear way to contact the outside world. The only certainty is that there is no immediate help coming.

SYNOPSIS = '''
The adventure begins as the player arrives in Narvik after a long, solitary hike. The town is eerily quiet, with abandoned vehicles, looted stores, and signs of violence. The player gradually discovers the presence of the infected, forcing them to seek safety and supplies.
As the player explores, they will encounter various survivor groups, each with different motivations:
A small group of survivors trying to find a way out of the city.
A more ruthless faction controlling key resources, willing to kill to keep their power.
A scientist or medic searching for answers about the infection.
The main objectives for the adventure involve finding a way to escape Narvik, determining if there is a safe zone or evacuation point, and learning the truth about the outbreak. Along the way, the player will face moral dilemmas—helping others, making enemies, or choosing self-preservation above all else.
The endgame depends on the player’s choices:
Escape Narvik, either alone or with other survivors.
Uncover the origin of the infection and decide whether to share this knowledge.
Fall victim to the infected or hostile survivors and meet an untimely end.
The journey will be defined by limited resources, dangerous encounters, and tough choices, leading to multiple possible conclusions.
