'''ICU disaster'''

SHORT_DESCRIPTION = "Problems at a university hospital intensive care unit"

STYLE = "cartoon"

CONTEXT = '''
The adventure takes place in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of a large university hospital, a high-pressure environment where the critically ill are treated and every second counts. The ICU is equipped with state-of-the-art monitoring systems, ventilators, and life-support machines, but even the best technology is useless without the right diagnosis and decisions.
The player is an anesthesiologist, a highly trained specialist in critical care, pain management, and emergency interventions. The player is responsible for managing a particularly difficult patient whose condition is rapidly deteriorating.
The patient's exact illness is unknown at the start. The only certainty is that their vital signs are unstable, they are unresponsive, and conventional treatments have failed. It is up to the player to stabilize the patient, investigate their condition, and determine the correct treatment before it is too late.
The hospital follows a hierarchical structure, and the player is not alone in the ICU:
Nurse Sofia L., a seasoned ICU nurse with years of experience.
Competent, sharp-witted, but skeptical of experimental treatments.
Has seen it all but is still haunted by the rare cases she couldn’t save.
Her primary concern is patient safety—she will challenge risky decisions.
Nurse Elias K., a younger but highly skilled ICU nurse.
Calm under pressure, resourceful, and adaptable.
Has a strong grasp of ICU protocols and is willing to think outside the box.
Occasionally doubts the strict hierarchies in medicine and prefers a team-based approach.
Dr. Linnea R., a junior doctor, currently in her third year of residency.
Bright, motivated, but easily overwhelmed by high-pressure situations.
Struggles with making quick decisions, often hesitating before acting.
Looks up to the player for guidance but may second-guess their choices if things go wrong.
Consultant Dr. Henrik W., the ICU department head.
Rarely present in person, but his approval is needed for high-risk procedures.
Highly respected but bureaucratic—believes in protocols over improvisation.
May oppose the player’s decisions if they go against established guidelines.
Family Members, occasionally present.
Desperate, emotional, and sometimes obstructive.
Some demand immediate interventions, others distrust medical professionals.
The player must balance medical objectivity with human compassion.

SYNOPSIS = '''
The adventure begins when the player is called to the ICU for an emergency case—a patient in critical condition whose symptoms defy easy classification. The patient is unresponsive, experiencing severe respiratory distress, and deteriorating despite initial treatments.

The player must:
Assess the situation – Examine the patient, review their chart, and analyze vital signs.
Order diagnostic tests – Labs, imaging, and other investigations are available but take time.
Initiate treatment – Standard ICU protocols may not be enough; the player must decide when to escalate care.
Collaborate or clash with colleagues – Nurses, residents, and senior doctors may support or challenge the player’s decisions.
The exact cause of the patient’s condition is initially unknown, and the LLM can choose from multiple possible scenarios, such as:
A rare autoimmune disease attacking the patient’s lungs, requiring an unconventional immunosuppressive approach.
A rapidly progressing sepsis from an unknown source, demanding aggressive antibiotics and fluid management.
A drug overdose or poisoning, with an unknown toxin affecting multiple organ systems.
A hidden neurological condition mimicking a critical illness, requiring a completely different approach.
A mysterious viral outbreak, raising ethical concerns about quarantine and public health measures.
The player’s choices will lead to different paths:
The patient stabilizes, but complications arise—forcing further intervention.
The wrong treatment worsens the condition, requiring a desperate last-minute decision.
An external event (power failure, mass casualty situation, hospital politics) disrupts the process, adding urgency.
The patient does not survive, but the cause is discovered—leading to hard lessons or even a mystery to uncover.
The endgame depends on the player’s actions:
A successful recovery—The player solves the case, saving the patient’s life.
Partial success—The patient survives, but with permanent complications.
Failure—The patient dies, leaving behind unanswered questions.
Ethical Dilemma—The player uncovers something bigger than this single case (e.g., medical malpractice, a new epidemic, or a cover-up).
The game is defined by tense medical decision-making, time pressure, ethical dilemmas, and interpersonal challenges, creating a high-stakes, immersive ICU adventure.
