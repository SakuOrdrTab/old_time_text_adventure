'''Edo romance adventure'''

SHORT_DESCRIPTION = '''
A romantic adventure in Edo period Japan
'''

STYLE = "japanese wood painting"

CONTEXT = '''
The adventure takes place in Edo-period Japan (17th–19th century), a time of honor, duty, and strict societal divisions. The nation is at peace under the rule of the Tokugawa Shogunate, but this peace is fragile—clan rivalries, political intrigues, and personal struggles still shape lives.
The player is a young samurai, recently returned to their hometown after years of training under a master swordsman. However, the adventure is not about war or glory, but about matters of the heart—a journey of love, duty, and choices that will shape the player’s fate.
Love is not simple in this world. Marriages are often arranged, and personal emotions must bow before honor and obligation. But sometimes, fate weaves a different path, offering moments of passion, longing, and quiet defiance against tradition.
The setting is a peaceful town in central Japan, nestled between rolling green hills, cherry blossom groves, and a great river where boats drift lazily under the spring sky. A towering daimyō’s castle oversees the land, its banners fluttering in the wind.
The characters surrounding the player are deeply intertwined in this world of duty, expectation, and hidden feelings:

Lady Akiko, the daimyō’s daughter
Graceful, intelligent, and bound by duty.
Engaged to a powerful noble whom she has never met.
Feels a quiet rebellion in her heart—yearning for freedom, but trapped by her family’s expectations.
The player knew her in childhood, before status separated them.

Yukio, the wandering poet and musician
Gentle, artistic, and speaks in riddles.
Drifts from town to town, singing of forbidden loves and ancient tragedies.
Carries a hidden sadness—is he running from something?
Knows secrets others do not and may guide the player toward truth.

Masaru, the honorable rival
A fellow samurai, disciplined and cold, yet deeply passionate about justice.
Sees the player as both a friend and an opponent.
Is secretly in love with someone he cannot have.
Will challenge the player if honor demands it.

Old Midori, the matchmaker and fortune teller
Mysterious, wise, and sharp-eyed.
Knows who loves whom before they even realize it themselves.
Offers cryptic advice—her words could be warnings, fate, or mischief.
The daimyō, Lord Takeda

Stern, powerful, and bound by his role.
Views marriage as a political tool and believes love is a weakness.
Commands absolute loyalty, but is not without a heart—can he be reasoned with?
Love, in this world, is not just a feeling—it is a battle against fate itself.

SYNOPSIS = '''
The adventure begins when the player returns home after years away, only to discover that Lady Akiko, once a childhood friend, is to be wed to a noble she has never met. This arranged marriage will bring power and wealth to the daimyō’s family—but at what cost?

The player, now a respected but lower-ranking samurai, is caught in the web of tradition, duty, and hidden emotions. They may choose to:

Respect the engagement and bury their feelings.
Help Akiko find happiness in her arranged life.
Defy the odds and pursue a forbidden love.
Seek another path—perhaps romance is waiting elsewhere?
Throughout the adventure, the player will face:

Moments of secret longing—unspoken words beneath the cherry blossoms.
Honor-bound challenges—Masaru may demand a duel if the player dishonors the code.
Mysterious messages—Yukio may know of hidden opportunities.
A test of courage—will the player risk reputation, or even life, for love?
The endgame depends on the player’s choices:

A noble sacrifice—Ensuring Akiko’s happiness, even if it means letting go.
A daring escape—Defying the daimyō’s wishes and fleeing into the unknown.
A tragic ending—Love lost due to honor, fate, or betrayal.
A political maneuver—Finding a way to change the daimyō’s mind through diplomacy or intrigue.
The game is a tale of restraint and passion, duty and defiance, longing and destiny, where every glance, every word, and every action could alter the course of love forever.
