SYNOPSIS = '''
The synopsis of the adventure game is, that at the start of the game, player returns to his home
from a succesfull hunting trip. However, his home has been attacked and whole family slaughered
and the house is burnt. This is all that the player knows. Of course he or she feels powerful
urge to avenge family's illfull fate.
The following is the suggested course of the adventure game:
- Player may want to learn some clues about the attackers. In fact it was a lapland raiding party,
but this is not evident and the player may find some clues that point to lapland
- If the player chooses to travel northwards towards lapland, he will encounter most bizarre events
and perils on the course.
- In the lapland, the actual attacking group has been powerful witch Louhi's men. In order to avenge,
player must deal with Louhi on some way or another.
- If player chooses to fight Louhi, this will be very difficult as Louhi is a powerful witch with magic,
as in Kalevala epic. It is very possible, that the player perishes.
- If the player perishes, there is a small chance that the adventure continues in "manala" which is the
mythological finnish afterlife.
- Succesful completion and the end of game is a suitable revenge for the gruesome loss of family.
